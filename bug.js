This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been properly initialized. This is common in asynchronous operations where the state might not be updated immediately after a function call.  For example, if you fetch data in componentDidMount, you may try to render it before the data is available.

```javascript
// Incorrect:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('some_api')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someField}</Text> {/*Error Here!*/}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
