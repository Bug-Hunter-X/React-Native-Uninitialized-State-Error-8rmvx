# React Native Uninitialized State Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it's been properly initialized after an asynchronous operation.  The error is often seen as `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someField')` or a similar message.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution using conditional rendering or the optional chaining operator.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
4. Observe the error message.

## Solution:

The solution involves checking if the state variable is initialized before accessing its properties. This can be done using conditional rendering or the optional chaining operator (`?.`).
